# ProtoMET
Matrix Expression Templates based on Boost.Proto

## Learning Boost.Proto
This is a yet another EDSL (embedded doamin-specific language)
for linear algebraic operations.
My goal is to make this EDSL help one (or me) to write 
a Poisson equation solver for steady-state thermal conduction. 

Actually I'm still learning to use Boost.Proto and have
very hard time because there is no tutorial focusing on matrices and vectors.
Although the users' guide of Boost.Proto
and 'Expressive C++' articles are comprehensive, they are overwhelming
so that I'm not sure which parts are essential for mathematical expressions.

So I decided to put here such prototypes focusing on matrix and vector operations until I reach the goal.
